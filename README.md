# Frontend Mentor Challenge | Results Summary
### by Michael I

<hr>

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data for the results in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to add the results and total score dynamically if you choose.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Want some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

## Process

I wasn't able to replicate this on my own, I had to follow through Kevin Powell's tutorial on how to do this problem, but still wanted to upload it so others could see the final result as well as follow along themselves if they wanted.
